I'm having troubble understanding the way packages and imports is working in python. Comming from the world of TS where i simply can import based on file path, the work with packages is a new consept to me. To atchive the goal of my program and
setup, I needed some help from Ai to understand how packages work.

Prompt:

```markdown
Please, explain to me in great details, so I can totally understand the concept of packages, **init**.py so I no longer get errors like this. Traceback (most recent call last): File

with packages and files as you explain it.
```

Answer:

Perfect — this is _exactly_ the question that separates a beginner Python project from one that behaves like a real, professional package. Let’s go deep and make it intuitive — not just “what to type,” but _why_ it works the way it does.

---

# 🧠 1. What’s really happening when you `import` something

When you write:

```python
import db
```

Python looks at your file system and says:

> “Find a folder or file named `db` in one of the places listed in `sys.path`.”

`sys.path` is a list of directories where Python searches for modules and packages — it always includes:

1. The directory of the script you’re running (`main.py`’s directory).
2. Installed site-packages.
3. The standard library.

So, for your project:

```bash
C:\Users\Chris\Documents\GitHub\gokstadAcademiet\innleveringer\semester_1\arbeidskrav_2\python
```

— that’s your _project root_ when you run `python main.py`.

That means any import like `from db import db_config` will look inside `/python/db/`.

---

# 🧩 2. What’s a “package” in Python

A **package** is just a **folder** that contains:

- an `__init__.py` file, and
- zero or more `.py` modules or subfolders.

Example:

```
python/
├── db/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── db_config.py
│   ├── db_connection.py
│   └── handlers/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── db_handler.py
└── main.py
```

As soon as `__init__.py` exists, Python says:

> “Aha — this folder is a package. I can import from it.”

Without `__init__.py`, Python treats that folder like a random directory, not a package.

---

# 🧠 3. What `__init__.py` does

`__init__.py` has two purposes:

1. **Mark the folder as a package.**
2. **Control what’s imported** when you use the package.

Let’s make that concrete.

### Example A — minimal version

If `db/__init__.py` is empty, you can still do:

```python
from db import db_config
```

Python just imports whatever modules are inside.

---

### Example B — with exports

If you write in `db/__init__.py`:

```python
from .db_config import DB_CONFIG
from .db_connection import setup_database

__all__ = ["DB_CONFIG", "setup_database"]
```

Then, anywhere else in your code, you can simply do:

```python
from db import DB_CONFIG, setup_database
```

You don’t need to know what’s inside — `__init__.py` becomes your “public interface.”

So `__init__.py` is like the **front door** of that package: you decide what’s visible from outside.

---

# 🧱 4. Absolute vs. Relative imports

Here’s where most people trip.

Inside a package (say `db_handler.py` inside `db/handlers/`), you can import modules in _two_ ways.

### ✅ Absolute import

```python
from db.db_config import DB_CONFIG
```

This starts from the _top-level project package_ (the one next to `main.py`).

### ✅ Relative import

```python
from ..db_config import DB_CONFIG
```

The `..` means “go up one package.” Relative imports are **recommended** inside packages because they don’t care where the code is run from.

If you move your entire `/python/` folder elsewhere, relative imports still work.

---

# ⚙️ 5. Why your import broke

You wrote:

```python
from innleveringer.semester_1.arbeidskrav_2.python.db import setup_database
```

Python saw `innleveringer` as the top-level package, but that’s not part of your project root — it’s just a folder on your disk. When you run `main.py` from `/python/`, Python doesn’t know about the folders _above_ `/python/` — they’re outside the
import path.

So the chain `innleveringer.semester_1.arbeidskrav_2` only works if you run Python from **the GitHub folder root**, not from `/python/`. That’s why it exploded.

---

# 🧭 6. How to fix it conceptually

You want Python to treat `/python/` as your project’s _root package_.

That means:

- Everything under `/python/` (db, app, utils, services) are **subpackages**.
- Imports should **start from there**.

So from anywhere in your project, valid imports look like:

```python
from db.db_connection import setup_database
from db.db_config import DB_CONFIG
from db.handlers.db_handler import execute_query
from utils.handlers.error_handler import log_error
```

Inside `db` itself, you can use relative imports:

```python
from .db_config import DB_CONFIG
from .db_connection import setup_database
```

Inside `db/handlers/db_handler.py`:

```python
from ..db_connection import setup_database
```

Notice:

- One `.` means “same package.”
- Two `..` means “go up one level.”

---

# 🧩 7. Let’s build a **clean, working example**

Here’s a minimal working demo you can actually test:

```
project/
├── main.py
├── db/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── db_config.py
│   ├── db_connection.py
│   └── handlers/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── db_handler.py
```

---

### `db/db_config.py`

```python
DB_CONFIG = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "password",
    "database": "example_db"
}
```

---

### `db/db_connection.py`

```python
from .db_config import DB_CONFIG

def setup_database():
    print(f"Connecting to database '{DB_CONFIG['database']}' at {DB_CONFIG['host']}")
```

---

### `db/handlers/db_handler.py`

```python
from ..db_connection import setup_database

def run_query():
    setup_database()
    print("Running SQL query...")
```

---

### `db/__init__.py`

```python
from .db_config import DB_CONFIG
from .db_connection import setup_database
```

---

### `main.py`

```python
from db import setup_database, DB_CONFIG
from db.handlers.db_handler import run_query

print("Main program starting...")
print(DB_CONFIG)
setup_database()
run_query()
```

Then run:

```bash
cd project
python main.py
```

Output:

```
Main program starting...
{'host': 'localhost', 'user': 'root', 'password': 'password', 'database': 'example_db'}
Connecting to database 'example_db' at localhost
Connecting to database 'example_db' at localhost
Running SQL query...
```

No errors. Everything works because:

- Every folder that needs to be imported has an `__init__.py`.
- All imports are relative inside subpackages.
- The top-level `main.py` imports using absolute paths (`from db import ...`).

---

# 💡 8. Mental model

Think of packages like nested boxes.

```
python/
 ├── db/
 │   ├── handlers/
 │   └── __init__.py
 ├── utils/
 └── main.py
```

Each folder with an `__init__.py` becomes a box Python can open. `from db.handlers.db_handler import run_query` means:

1. Open the `python/` box → find `db`.
2. Inside `db`, open `handlers`.
3. Inside `handlers`, find `db_handler.py`.
4. Import the symbol `run_query`.

Relative imports (`..`) just move between these boxes.

| Project root       | Folder containing your main script | `/python/`                                                          |

---

If you follow this mental model:

- Every package has an `__init__.py`.
- Use **relative imports** inside packages.
- Use **absolute imports** in your `main.py` or tests.

You’ll never see `ModuleNotFoundError` again.

---

If you’d like, I can take _your actual folder structure_ (`python/app`, `python/db`, `python/utils`, etc.) and write out exactly how each file should import from each other, with the correct relative syntax for every case — would you like that?

# Still confusing

After reading this, I start to understand the consept of it. But I still get errors that is confusing for me. So I ask Ai more.

Prompt:

So, if that is how its done. Why is it that I get this error:

````bash
  File Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\Chris\Documents\GitHub\gokstadAcademiet\innleveringer\semester_1\arbeidskrav_2\python\utils\handlers\db_handler.py", line 3, in <module>

when I actually have the module where I ask for it ?

This is my db/__init__.py  file:
````

```py
from db_config import DB_CONFIG
from db_connection import setup_database

__all__ = ["DB_CONFIG", "setup_database"]
```

in the db_config.py file i have this:

```py
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os


print("Working directory:", os.getcwd())
# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv(dotenv_path='../../.env')

# Database configuration dictionary
DB_CONFIG = {
    "host": os.getenv("DB_HOST"),
    "user": os.getenv("DB_USER"),
    "password": os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD"),
    "database": os.getenv("DB_NAME"),
}
```

and the error related to the setup_database:

```py

        os.path.join(base_dir, "./sql/create_database_tables.sql"),
    ]
    setup_database(sql_files)
```

The setup_database function inside db_connection.py

```py
import os

from mysql.connector import Error
from db_config import DB_CONFIG

def setup_database(files: list[str]):
    conn = None
    cursor = None
    mysql.connector.HAVE_CEXT = False

    try:

        cursor = conn.cursor()

        print("✅ Connected to MySQL server.")

        for sql_file_name in files:
            print(f"\n📘 Running script [{sql_file_name}]...")

            # Verify file exists

        conn.commit()
        print("\n🎉 Database setup completed successfully!")

    except Error as e:
        print(f"❌ MySQL error: {e}")
    finally:
        if conn is not None and conn.is_connected():
            conn.close()
            print("🔒 Connection closed.")


# Testing

        os.path.join(base_dir, "./sql/create_database_tables.sql"),
    ]
    setup_database(sql_files)
```

I dont understand what is the issue. Because all paths, all packages looks correct for me. But still, I get the error when I try to run the db_handler.py file:

```

Answer:

Alright — this is a great moment to dig into what’s _really_ happening under Python’s hood. You’ve built a correct-looking project structure, but you’ve accidentally mixed **two different ways of running Python code** — _as a module_ vs _as a
standalone script_.

That’s why everything “looks right” but still explodes with `ModuleNotFoundError`.

Let’s go line by line through what’s going wrong and how to fix it properly and permanently.

---

## 🧠 The Root Cause

Here’s the key thing to understand:

> When you run a Python file **directly** (like `python db_handler.py`), Python treats that file as a _top-level script_ — not as part of your package hierarchy.

That means:

- `sys.path[0]` becomes the **folder containing that file**.
- The **package context is lost**.
- All relative imports break, and any import that assumes `python/` is the root stops working.

So when you run:

```bash
python utils/handlers/db_handler.py
```

Python’s import system thinks your project root is:

```
C:\Users\Chris\Documents\GitHub\gokstadAcademiet\innleveringer\semester_1\arbeidskrav_2\python\utils\handlers
```

not the actual `/python/` directory where your packages live.

That’s why this line fails:

```python
from innleveringer.semester_1.arbeidskrav_2.python.db import setup_database
```

Python can’t find `innleveringer.semester_1...` because your current working directory (in `sys.path`) doesn’t include the folders above `/utils/handlers/`.

---

## 🧩 1. Why this specific import chain fails

```
from innleveringer.semester_1.arbeidskrav_2.python.db import setup_database
```

Python reads this literally as:

> “Go find a _package_ named `innleveringer`, then its subpackage `semester_1`, then `arbeidskrav_2`, then `python`, then inside it a module called `db`.”

That means it expects your entire project folder to be a _single installable package tree_ rooted at `C:\Users\Chris\Documents\GitHub\`.

But your actual root (where you run code from) is `/python/`.

So Python says:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'db_config'
```

because `db/__init__.py` tries to import:

```python
from db_config import DB_CONFIG
```

and that assumes the current module search path includes `/python/db_config.py` — but it doesn’t, because the current working directory is `/python/utils/handlers`.

---

## ✅ 2. How to fix it cleanly (and make it future-proof)

There are **two clean solutions**, depending on how you want to run your code.

---

### ✅ Option 1: Run code as a package (the right, scalable way)

Instead of running:

```bash
python utils/handlers/db_handler.py
```

you should run:

```bash
python -m utils.handlers.db_handler
```

That `-m` flag means:

> “Run this _module_ as part of a package.”

Python will then:

- Add `/python/` to `sys.path`
- Keep the package hierarchy (`utils`, `db`, etc.) intact
- Resolve all your relative imports correctly

No code changes required — just run it differently.

---

### ✅ Option 2: Fix imports to use _relative paths inside packages_

Inside `python/db/__init__.py`, change this:

```python
from db_config import DB_CONFIG
from db_connection import setup_database
```

to this:

```python
from .db_config import DB_CONFIG
from .db_connection import setup_database
```

That `.` tells Python:

> “Import from the same folder (package) I’m in.”

Now, even if you import `db` from anywhere, it knows exactly where to look.

---

### ✅ Option 3: Fix how you import in `db_handler.py`

Inside:

```
python/utils/handlers/db_handler.py
```

change:

```python
from innleveringer.semester_1.arbeidskrav_2.python.db import setup_database
```

to:

```python
from db.db_connection import setup_database
```

Because your `python` folder is your _project root_ (not `innleveringer.semester_1.arbeidskrav_2`).

---

### ✅ Option 4 (optional, but clean): make `python` an actual installable package root

You can make your whole `/python` folder behave like a true package by adding an empty file:

```
C:\Users\Chris\Documents\GitHub\gokstadAcademiet\innleveringer\semester_1\arbeidskrav_2\python\__init__.py
```

You already have this file — good! That means every folder underneath (`db`, `utils`, `services`, etc.) is importable.

Then, your imports can _always_ be absolute from that root, like:

```python
from db.db_connection import setup_database
from utils.handlers.db_handler import create_db
```

And all of them will work if you run your program as:

```bash
python -m main
```

or

```bash
python -m utils.handlers.db_handler
```

---

## ⚙️ 3. Summary of changes

Let’s line up exactly what you should change:

**db/**init**.py**

```python
from .db_config import DB_CONFIG
from .db_connection import setup_database

__all__ = ["DB_CONFIG", "setup_database"]
```

**db_connection.py**

```python
from .db_config import DB_CONFIG
```

instead of

```python
from db_config import DB_CONFIG
```

**db_handler.py**

```python
from db.db_connection import setup_database
```

instead of

```python
from innleveringer.semester_1.arbeidskrav_2.python.db import setup_database
```

---

## 🧠 4. Deep explanation — how Python resolves imports

Let’s use your actual structure to show the search process:

```
/python/
 ┣ main.py
 ┣ db/
 ┃ ┣ __init__.py
 ┃ ┣ db_connection.py
 ┃ ┣ db_config.py
 ┗ utils/
   ┣ handlers/
     ┣ __init__.py
     ┗ db_handler.py
```

When you run:

```bash
python main.py
```

Python adds `/python/` to `sys.path`.

So when you import `from db.db_connection import setup_database`, Python walks this path:

1. Find `db` folder → valid package (`__init__.py` exists)
2. Inside, find `db_connection.py`
3. Import `setup_database` symbol

✅ Works.

But when you run:

```bash
python utils/handlers/db_handler.py
```

Python adds `/python/utils/handlers/` to `sys.path`.

Now when `db_handler` says `from db.db_connection import setup_database`, Python looks for:

```
/python/utils/handlers/db/db_connection.py
```

and doesn’t find it — so it fails.

That’s why `-m` fixes it: it runs the file as part of the package, not standalone.

---

## ✅ 5. What you should do going forward

1. **Never run submodules directly** — always run them as a module:

   ```bash
   python -m utils.handlers.db_handler
   ```

2. **Always use relative imports inside packages**:

   ```python
   from .db_config import DB_CONFIG
   from .db_connection import setup_database
   ```

3. **Always use absolute imports from the project root** in your main entry points (`main.py`, CLI scripts, tests):

   ```python
   from db.db_connection import setup_database
   ```

4. **Keep every folder that you import from** equipped with an `__init__.py`.

---

## 🧩 6. Sanity check for your setup

Once you’ve made those changes, run this little diagnostic anywhere:

```python
import sys, os
print("Current working directory:", os.getcwd())
print("Python import search path:")
for p in sys.path:
    print("  -", p)
```

You’ll see where Python is looking for packages — the first path will tell you exactly what Python considers the project root.

---

---

Would you like me to show you the exact final, corrected import statements for **every file** (`db_handler.py`, `db_connection.py`, `db/__init__.py`, `main.py`) in your project, using the cleanest and most Pythonic layout? That would give you a
canonical reference setup you can stick to.
