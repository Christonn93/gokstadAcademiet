    # Establish a database connection (reuse an existing connection or create a new one)

    # Create a cursor object to interact with the database

    # Prepare the SQL query (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE)

    # Execute the query using cursor.execute()

    # If it's a SELECT query, fetch the results (fetchone, fetchall, etc.)

    # Handle potential MySQL errors with try/except for Error

    # Close the cursor and connection to free resources

    # Optionally return query results or confirmation of success
