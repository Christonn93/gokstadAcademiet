    """Remove (drop) the existing database and all its tables"""

    # Establish a connection to the MySQL server (not the specific database)

    # Create a cursor object for executing SQL statements

    # Write a SQL command to drop the database (e.g., "DROP DATABASE db_name")

    # Execute the DROP DATABASE command

    # Commit the change to ensure the database is removed

    # Handle potential MySQL errors (e.g., database does not exist)

    # Close the cursor and connection to clean up resources

    # Optionally print or return confirmation that the database was dropped
