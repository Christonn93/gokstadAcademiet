# Comments to the main.py file

After talk with Marius, I have tried collection all my single-function-files into one class. I have had some assistance from
ai to try and understand what a class is and how to build it up. 

I did not manage to get this solution to work before the delivery. 
It's some bugs in it that have not yet ben able to figure out. 

I have tried solving these bugs by not using AI. But something is not clicking correctly.
